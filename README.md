teslacoil
=========

A Society of Software Engineers project that involves building a Tesla Coil. The point of the project is to develop a Tesla Coil that is able to play 2 different notes with just one Tesla Coil. What this program is going to do is at first take in a file which will tell the Tesla Coil what to play. After it can run an already built file it will also have an interface to build a file for the Tesla Coil to run.
